This is made on RPG maker MV (which was kindly gifted to me by Crusader). So no need for RTPs etc.

Disclaimer: The main 'storyline' in this game can probably be completed in under an hour. However, judging it by that standard is rather missing the point - there are so many more fun things to do than just run through the storyline. But, this also means I'm not going to waste your time with grinding or unnecessary long exposition. Just go in and have fun!
